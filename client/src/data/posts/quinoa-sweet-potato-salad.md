It is silky and slightly creamy, spicy, garlicky (!!), and a little tangy and salty from the soy sauce and rice vinegar. I literally just whispered “oof” outloud as I am reliving it in my mind. It’s so good.

It has very quickly earned a top spot in my list of Favorite Sauces of 2024, and it takes all of five minutes to make. WHEEE! Things I have used this sauce on:

- a dip for air fryer chicken (this was the OG, which naturally leads to…)
- a dip for air fryer tofu!
- and a dip for the air fryer salmon!
- a smashburger!
- a salad dressing!
- a sauce on a rice bowl!
- a drizzle for a wrap or sandwich!

It’s just the sauce of my life these days. Initially I just tucked it into the notes of the air fryer chicken post, because I thought – it won’t need its own blog post because I mostly will only use it for this? which was very delusional. Because then I started putting it on everything. And I realized it needs its own home here on POY.

##### Mix up your sauce ingredients.
Love a one-step recipe.
##### You’re Done! Yum!
Use it to dip, dunk, drizzle, spread, swoop, and/or all of the above. Here is a picture of this gochujang sauce on a kale and cabbage salad (similar to this guy!) with air fryer chicken on top.
