It’s a textural wonder: a gentle layering of juicy and slippery, flexible and foldy. We’ve got fresh cucumber, bitey shallots, cooling mint, and sweet fleshy peaches coming together in serious flavor harmony. The lime juice in there wakes it up and makes it feel extra summery, and the flecks of lime zest, salt, and pepper make it feel like something you’d eat at a nice restaurant. 
###### Slice That Peachy Goodness!
Slices are ideal, in my opinion! Those thin, long pieces just layer together really nicely. You can do it by hand, but a mandoline is my must-have tool for this!


##### Get The Cucumbers Saucy.
I kind of like the cucumbers to have a softer, more bendy quality in this salad, so I let them sit with the shallots in lime juice, salt, and olive oil for a while to loosen em up.

##### Add Peaches, Mint, and Honey!
Give it a gentle toss. Season as you like. I love hot honey in this salad. Like, LOVE.

##### You’re Done! Yum!
Seriously so good. One of my favorites for a quick, beautiful, fresh summer meal or side. Also great with avocado slices in there!
