The cauliflower is roasty and seasoned to the max, and the chickpeas get just a little bit chunky and creamy when you give them a few good smashed. They’re just a bit TOO round sometimes, ya know?

You can make a butter sauce from scratch, or you can just do as I’ve been doing and buy the KFI brand butter chicken sauce from Costco which comes in a big jar and works like a charm. I’ve also heard via your DMs on Instagram that their Vindaloo sauce is even better. If you don’t have a Costco, any brand of tikka masala or Indian-spiced simmer sauces that you love would work just as well (and you can give it some love with a bit of extra cream or butter).

###### Season and Roast the Cauliflower.
Coat the cauliflower in spices and some avocado oil. Roast in the oven or air fryer till it’s roasty and yummy.

###### Activate Your Yummy Butter Sauce.
Homemade, with a pureed base of onions, garlic, ginger, spices, and tomato sauce plus cream and butter, is delicious. Or… just use a store-bought sauce! Costco sells KFI brand butter chicken sauce and I’ve been enjoying it as an SOS option.

###### Add Your Chickpeas and Mash.
Okay, you don’t have to mash them. But sometimes chickpeas are just a bit too round. If you can understand that weird sentiment, you’ll probably enjoy a bit of mashing for texture.

###### Add Cauliflower Back In.
Here she comes, looking nice and roasty!  

###### You’re Done! Yum!
I love, love, love this with some kind of a cilantro sauce which is why you’ll see a waterfall of it on my bowl here.
