short: Golden, juicy chicken coated in a simple creamy sauce with tomatoes, garlic, and thyme. I love this with mashed potatoes and a salad!

Marry Me Chicken has been around for a while, but this month has been my first time trying it. The original version pan fries the chicken in the same pan as the sauce – and this makes sense in theory, but you guys, I just love the air fryer chicken. It tastes better. It’s more consistent and reliable. It’s juicy and it’s got great flavor, exterior texture, and color. It’s hands-off. It’s just about the only way that I make chicken now. I’m willing to wash one extra dish (the air fryer basket) in favor of having my favorite juicy chicken with the golden crust on the outside.

The other difference here is that original Marry Me Chicken also has sun-dried tomatoes, but I don’t LOVE-love sun-drieds, so I went with a jar of DeLallo marinated bruschetta-style tomatoes which are fresher and juicier (similar to juicy petite diced canned or fresh tomatoes), and boom! It was divine.


###### Get it all ready to go.
Prep the chicken. Thinly slice some garlic. Drain your tomatoes.

###### Start the Garlic, Butter, and Tomato Paste.
Get these three going over low heat to start to develop some flavor.

###### Add Cream, Broth, and Thyme.
Whisk and then let it all simmer up for a while so it can thicken into a nice sauce.

###### Add Chicken and Tomatoes.
Pull out the sprigs of thyme and get your tomatoes in the sauce. Finally, tuck those gorgeous pieces of chicken into the whole thing.

###### You’re Done! Yum!
OOOH MY the flavor of that sauce is just next level. Are we in a restaurant right now? I think we’re in a restaurant.
