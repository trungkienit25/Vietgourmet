Garlic, ginger, soy, and curry powder with the umami of beef is not going to let you down. It’s just not, okay?

For the air fryer, I like to have the texture being sticky / wet enough that you can kind of squeeze it into loose chunks. If the rice is dried out / several days leftover, I will add a tablespoon or two of water and maybe even a bit of cornstarch to the mix to help it revive a bit.\r\n\r\n##### Clump Your Rice Into the Air Fryer.\r\nYes, clump it. Just place sticky handfuls of the rice in the air fryer in a single layer. They don’t have to be balls, but you also don’t want each individual grain of rice to be separated. Just kinda clump it in there.\r\n\r\n##### Air Fry the Rice!\r\nI do it at 420 for about 8 minutes till it’s nice and golden brown and crispy around the edges! (If you don’t have an air fryer, there are other options in the notes.) See how it kind of makes clusters? When it’s done, scoop chunks of the rice onto your salad bowl! \r\n\r\n##### Toss It Up!\r\nToss the veggies and rice with the dressing.\r\n##### You’re done! YUM!\r\nSeriously.

It’s more consistent and reliable. It’s juicy and it’s got great flavor, exterior texture, and color. It’s hands-off. It’s just about the only way that I make chicken now. I’m willing to wash one extra dish (the air fryer basket) in favor of having my favorite juicy chicken with the golden crust on the outside.\r\n\r\nThe other difference here is that original Marry Me Chicken also has sun-dried tomatoes, but I don’t LOVE-love sun-drieds, so I went with a jar of DeLallo marinated bruschetta-style tomatoes which are fresher and juicier (similar to juicy petite diced canned or fresh tomatoes), and boom!
