##### Season the Chicken

Three primary ingredients: taco seasoning, garlic, and a shot of soy sauce! I’m showing the taco seasoning on the chicken first in this picture, but I’ve come to realize that mixing works best if you start with the wet stuff (oil and soy sauce) and then finish with a quick toss in the dry spices! Doesn’t get quite so clumpy.

##### Cook the Chicken

I like to air fry it – 425 degrees for 11 minutes.

##### Make a Green Sauce

Not essential, but this is the kind of sauce that makes life worth living.

##### Cut Up The Chicken

Just give it a good rough chop into little bite-sized pieces, like how it is at Chipotle. While you have the cutting board out, go ahead and chop some cilantro and onions, too!You’re Done! Yum!
