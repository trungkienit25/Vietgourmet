I’ve done this with both ground chicken and ground turkey – I prefer turkey, maybe because it has a bit more fat? Ground beef also works, as does Italian sausage – and maybe you want to mix and match because this recipe is begging to be doubled.

As far as serving goes, it is physically impossible for us to NOT have these with garlic bread. I adore this garlic bread so much. But good old buttered noodles would work, too! And for veggies, a simple green salad, bagged Caesar salad, or steam-in-the-bag green beans on the side – all great options.

###### Combine the meatball mixture

Everything all in one bowl! No cutting board required.

###### Roll into Meatballs
Place them in an oiled pan to prevent sticking

###### Bake the Meatballs.

400 degrees for 20-25 minutes, to golden, juicy perfection.

###### Add Sauce
I just add a jar of sauce directly to the pan.

###### Add the crispy topping.

Optional but fun! Gives the whole thing a little texture and bling. Broil for a few minutes to get it crispy!
