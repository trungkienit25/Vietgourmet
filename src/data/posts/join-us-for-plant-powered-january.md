THE FLAVOR. Garlic, ginger, soy, and curry powder with the umami of beef is not going to let you down. It’s just not, okay? It’s warming and rich (hello curry powder!) but pleasantly sharp at the same time (looking at you, garlic), and is it weird that I enjoy smelling it almost as much as I enjoy eating it?

THE STRIPS. They’re thin. They’re browned and caramelized but still juicy. They eat, honestly, like little bites of savory candy. They cook for 6 minutes, 7 tops. Delicious.

###### Cut the Beef into Thin Strips.

Cut against the grain into thin strips. If the skirt steak itself is very thin, fold it over itself a few times to make it easier to cut (as shown in this picture).

###### Add Some Flavor.
Add garlic, ginger, soy sauce, curry powder, salt, and sugar. MAGIC, I’m telling you.

###### Skewer (Or Not).
FYI, things smell amazing at this point. Scrunch that yummy beef onto soaked skewers! Doesn’t have to be perfect. If that feels like too much work, skip it! You can pan fry or air fry. Instructions are down below.

###### Blast Them With Heat.
Broil the skewers for 6 minutes. Caramelized on top, juicy, full of flavor. So good. (Alternate instructions below, too.)

##### You’re Done! Yum!
Pop the beef into a rice bowl with a little cucumber shallot salad. Highly recommend finishing with a drizzle of fish sauce and lime juice! Oooo-ee! Yum.
