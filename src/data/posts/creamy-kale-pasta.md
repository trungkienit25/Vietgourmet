Is it because it’s an excuse to load up half the plate with that gorgeous peach salad? Maybe. I love peaches.

But also, the shrimp are delicious! I made this one more time this afternoon to make sure I had the spices all correct before we published this recipe, and I ended up just standing over the pan eating just one more. And then just one more. And then just one more. They can easily stand on their own.

Besides being super easy (YAY IT’S MY FAVORITE THING), the thing I like about this is that it creates that mix of heat, smoke, and sweetness with some new flavors.

###### VMake Your Peach Salad

This can and probably should be made first… because the shrimp cook really fast. Chop, toss, and let it hang for the next 20 minutes while you do the shrimp!

###### Toss Shrimp with Spices

There’s smoked paprika, curry powder, salt, garlic powder, and some cayenne for heat.

###### Cook the shrimp
I cook them in olive oil, and then when they’re almost done I like to add a bit of butter and honey to the pan – it pulls up the browned bits and creates kind of a glazey sauce on the shrimp.

###### You’re Done! Yum!

Pile that steamy shrimp on rice with a big scoop of peach salad (also pictured here: avocado)! It’s so good.
